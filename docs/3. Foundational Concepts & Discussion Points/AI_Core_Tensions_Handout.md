### 🧠 Thinking vs. Replacing

| Tension               | Risk if Unbalanced           | What to Remember                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| "AI thinks for me"    | Overreliance, poor judgment  | Use AI to support reasoning, not bypass it |
| "AI replaces my work" | Fear, resistance to adoption | It's a partner, not a substitute           |

### 🎯 Prompting vs. Collaborating

| Tension                    | Risk if Unbalanced             | What to Remember                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| One-shot prompting         | Superficial or brittle results | Most good outcomes need back-and-forth |
| Prompt crafting as control | Over-engineering prompts       | CRAFT is a start, not the finish       |

### 🔐 Speed vs. Safety

| Tension        | Risk if Unbalanced              | What to Remember                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Rapid adoption | Governance gaps, data leakage   | Start with mock data and secure tools |
| Over-caution   | Missed innovation opportunities | Safe experimentation unlocks learning |

### ⚙️ Tools vs. Workflows

| Tension            | Risk if Unbalanced          | What to Remember                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Tool obsession     | Shiny object syndrome       | Workflow wins over tech hype                    |
| Ignoring platforms | Missed efficiency and reach | Meet people where they work (M365, Gmail, etc.) |

### 💬 Wrap-Up Thought

> “AI doesn’t eliminate trade-offs — it just reshapes them. The best practitioners navigate these tensions with clarity, not certainty. You don’t need to solve everything — you just need to notice where the friction lives.”
