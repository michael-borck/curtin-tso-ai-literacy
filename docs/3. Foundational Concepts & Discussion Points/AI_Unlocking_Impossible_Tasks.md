## 🌟 0:55–1:15 — Unlocking the Impossible

### 🌟 Purpose

Help participants see beyond automation. This is where AI stops being a time-saver and starts being a capability expander: doing things they *couldn't do before* due to time, skill, or resourcing constraints.

---

### 💡 Framing Statement

> “So far, we’ve looked at how to automate what you already do. Now let’s ask a better question: — What have you never been able to do because it felt too hard, too slow, or too expensive? AI may now make those things possible.”

### 🧠 Examples of "Impossible" Tasks AI Can Now Tackle

| Task Type            | Previously Hard/Impossible                        | Now Possible With AI                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Market synthesis     | Reading & comparing 5+ articles fast              | Summarise and extract insights instantly |
| Report repurposing   | Turning 1 report into 3 formats                   | Reformat for client, email, or blog post |
| Internal Q\&A        | Answering SOP/policy questions on demand          | Summarise docs into NotebookLM           |
| Competing viewpoints | Balanced review of opposing strategies            | Role-based prompting + simulated debate  |
| Strategic what-ifs   | Scenario exploration without spreadsheet buildout | Prompt-driven exploration and trade-offs |

# 📚 NotebookLM: AI That Knows Your Documents

## What is NotebookLM?
- Google’s AI notebook that reads and cites *your* content.
- Upload SOPs, reports, policies, and query them.
- Great for internal insights, onboarding, and strategy docs.

## Use Cases for Agvise
- Ask: “How do we usually advise on lease arrangements?”
- Summarise changes in advice over 3 years.
- New staff can ask Qs without bugging seniors.

## Limitations
- Not suitable for client-sensitive content (yet).
- Still in beta — best used for internal knowledge reuse.

## Summary
> “NotebookLM is like ChatGPT for your firm’s documents — but traceable and referenceable.”

### 🤖 Optional Tool Demo: NotebookLM


**What it is:** Google's experimental AI tool that lets you upload documents and then chat with them.

**What to say:**

* "Instead of re-reading a PDF, what if you could *ask* it questions?"
* "NotebookLM lets you build a project-specific brain. It doesn’t hallucinate from the web — it only uses the sources you upload."

> 📅 Tip: If participants don’t have access, show a screenshot or describe how it could work with farm performance reports or SOPs.

### 🧠 Discussion Prompt

> “What’s something you’ve *wanted* to do for clients, but never had the time or tools for?”
> “What would a junior analyst, working 24/7 and able to read anything instantly, let you do more of?”

---

### ✅ Optional Micro-Exercise: Reverse Prompt

> “Start with a task you’ve never had time for. Now write a prompt that *tries* to do that thing. What happens?”

Example:

> "Write a benchmarking summary comparing this year’s farm performance to 3 previous seasons. Highlight weather-adjusted yield impact and price trends."

---

### 🔹 Key Takeaway

> "Automation is good. But transformation is better. The real power of AI is doing things you couldn’t do before. This is where competitive advantage lives."
