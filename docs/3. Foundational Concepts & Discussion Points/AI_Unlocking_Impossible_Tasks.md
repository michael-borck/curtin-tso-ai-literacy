## 🌟 0:55–1:15 — Unlocking the Impossible

### 🌟 Purpose

Help participants see beyond automation. This is where AI stops being a time-saver and starts being a capability expander: doing things they *couldn't do before* due to time, skill, or resourcing constraints.

---

### 💡 Framing Statement

> "So far, we've looked at how to automate what you already do with Copilot. Now let's explore what becomes possible when we think bigger - both with tools available today and secure solutions on the horizon."

### 🧠 Examples of "Impossible" Tasks AI Can Now Tackle

| Task Type            | Previously Hard/Impossible                        | Now Possible With AI                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Market synthesis     | Reading & comparing 5+ articles fast              | Summarise and extract insights instantly |
| Report repurposing   | Turning 1 report into 3 formats                   | Reformat for board, faculty, or students |
| Internal Q\&A        | Answering SOP/policy questions on demand          | Query docs via secure tools              |
| Competing viewpoints | Balanced review of opposing strategies            | Role-based prompting + simulated debate  |
| Strategic what-ifs   | Scenario exploration without spreadsheet buildout | Prompt-driven exploration and trade-offs |

# 📚 Future Possibility: Secure Document Q&A with Libre Chat

## What is Libre Chat?
- A potential secure platform for querying internal documents
- Could allow upload of policies, procedures, and TEQSA guidelines
- Currently under security review by IT team (Brenton and Matt)

## Potential Use Cases (Pending Approval)
- Ask: "What are the requirements for course accreditation at Curtin?"
- Query complex policy documents without manual searching
- Support new TSO staff with instant access to institutional knowledge

## Current Limitations
- Not yet approved for university use
- Data security and governance protocols being established
- Implementation timeline dependent on IT security review

## Summary
> "Libre Chat represents the future of secure, internal AI tools that respect data governance while enhancing productivity."

### 🤖 Current Reality: Working Within Our Tools


**What we have now:** Microsoft Copilot for secure, approved AI assistance

**What to emphasize:**

* "While we can't upload documents to query them yet, Copilot helps us work smarter with the data we have"
* "We're exploring secure solutions like Libre Chat that could enable document Q&A while maintaining data security"

> 📅 Note: Focus on what's possible today while acknowledging future potential

### 🧠 Discussion Prompt

> "What's something you've *wanted* to do for faculty support, but never had the time or tools for?"
> "What would a junior TSO assistant, working 24/7 and able to read any policy instantly, let you do more of?"

---

### ✅ Optional Micro-Exercise: Reverse Prompt

> “Start with a task you’ve never had time for. Now write a prompt that *tries* to do that thing. What happens?”

Example:

> "Write a benchmarking summary comparing this semester's unit performance to 3 previous semesters. Highlight enrollment trends, completion rates, and resource utilization patterns."

---

### 🔹 Key Takeaway

> "Automation is good. But transformation is better. The real power of AI is doing things you couldn’t do before. This is where competitive advantage lives."
