OK, cool. Right, so you can see that. Yeah, you can see that. OK, alright, so.
Jess Gibbs 0 minutes 17 seconds
Obviously there's a few self-explanatory things that will get updated, but yeah, so we can't use notebook LM, but we can speak to that for personal use, system access and requirements say Microsoft's OK, we won't be using Google account, although we can speak.
Jess Gibbs 0 minutes 37 seconds
To that for personal use access to. Yeah. So people will have access to copilot. I don't know when the inquiries agreement will be in place though, so we might have to wait. There might be an extra month before we get that. So that would just.
Jess Gibbs 0 minutes 55 seconds
Mean that our first session would be pushed out. There's not much else on the welcome page. Automate the TDs. This one's going to get tricky framing.
Jess Gibbs 1 minute 13 seconds
Oh, this is good.
Jess Gibbs 1 minute 15 seconds
My demo exam is conceptual. We'll work with mock data sets and public articles.
Jess Gibbs 1 minute 24 seconds
OK, so this is just prompt, this is just prompting which is fine. We just need to give it some some examples that are maybe relevant and that might be around so you guys have got some pretty complex spreadsheets so it might be around using copilot to ask it to fix a formula for you or.
Jess Gibbs 1 minute 42 seconds
Ask it if there is a formula that will do XY and Z or whatever it might be. So yeah, maybe if we could come up with a couple of we don't have to have 4:00, but if we could come up with some of these ideas for prompts that would be useful and some of them could be personal as well. They don't, you know, maybe, you know.

Emma Balaam 1 minute 47 seconds
Yeah.

Jess Gibbs
2 minutes 2 seconds2:02
Jess Gibbs 2 minutes 2 seconds
Two or three that are work related, so I would definitely suggest doing the Excel one only because it's like saved my life a million times over or even like when you can't get a formula to work and you're like ah so you copy and paste it and just say what's wrong with this formula and it gives you this massive explanation and fixes it for you.
Jess Gibbs 2 minutes 21 seconds
She's awesome. So yeah, I think that would be a good one.
Jess Gibbs 2 minutes 34 seconds
'Cause this is just the basic level.
Jess Gibbs 2 minutes 38 seconds
Could still potentially look at Libre, and I know you can upload relevant documents to it, I just don't know how it gets saved in Libre. But Claude is an enterprise agreement and it is sitting behind the walls, so we could always upload. You know we could do something around.
Jess Gibbs 2 minutes 58 seconds
Yeah.
Jess Gibbs 2 minutes 59 seconds
Like picking accreditation like a course that's got specific accreditation needs and all the different things that feed into any course review or something that could be a good example. Just narrow it down to one course for now or something like that.
Jess Gibbs 3 minutes 17 seconds
There might be something we could do.
Jess Gibbs 3 minutes 21 seconds
And because you've worked with education and accreditation, haven't you?

Emma Balaam
3 minutes 24 seconds3:24
Emma Balaam 3 minutes 24 seconds
Yeah, I'm a little weird. Yeah.

Jess Gibbs
3 minutes 26 seconds3:26
Jess Gibbs 3 minutes 26 seconds
Yeah, there might be something in there that we could do using Libre. We'll have to we'll have to touch base with Brenton on that one or Matt.
Jess Gibbs 3 minutes 41 seconds
Because they did a session with you, didn't they? With libre? What did they do?

Emma Balaam
3 minutes 46 seconds3:46
Emma Balaam 3 minutes 46 seconds
We did a bit of an impromptu sort of thing. We were talking to them about something else, and because we, I guess we're trying to work through, I don't know, Meg's done a bit. She did a little bit more with Brenton, just trying to work through how we can, like use it better.
Emma Balaam 4 minutes 5 seconds
In what we're doing, but we do kind of come up against the some of the data issues around what we can actually put in there and what we can't. Yeah. Meg had a was not last week, but the week before. And she's been on leave and I haven't had a chance to see how she's gone with that, but.

Jess Gibbs
4 minutes 15 seconds4:15
Jess Gibbs 4 minutes 15 seconds
Yeah.

Emma Balaam
4 minutes 24 seconds4:24
Emma Balaam 4 minutes 24 seconds
'Cause she. Yeah. She was trying to work with her. And I yeah, it was bit tricky. I think he was gonna have to take it away and see what he could do with it to see how we might be able to.

Jess Gibbs
4 minutes 33 seconds4:33
Jess Gibbs 4 minutes 33 seconds
Yeah.

Emma Balaam
4 minutes 36 seconds4:36
Emma Balaam 4 minutes 36 seconds
But like even trying to design the prompt and how much data we'll like, I guess have to feed into it to get it to to do the things that we might want it to do.

Jess Gibbs
4 minutes 47 seconds4:47
Jess Gibbs 4 minutes 47 seconds
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. OK. We might as part of this process, go back to Brenton and Matt and just have a bit of a chat about what we can do for some of these examples. And then?
Jess Gibbs 5 minutes 7 seconds
You know, maybe that could be the quick win might be just using Libre chat and setting it up so that we can do something that's more specific and tailored and it's already fiddled the information the only yeah. The only trick is that that you know your update, you're putting static documents into it, so you.
Jess Gibbs 5 minutes 24 seconds
You always need to make sure that you're using relevant documents.
Jess Gibbs 5 minutes 30 seconds
Remember that so that can be part of your prompts that whenever the output comes out, it gives you, you know, the source that it's referencing in the date, and you know as part of that, you've when you've given it the information you've seen, when it should be renewed. And so it might flag in your report or whatever the writing.
Jess Gibbs 5 minutes 50 seconds
That it spits out at you. It might flag that it's potential that this accreditation document is out of date. Please check, blah blah blah, you know. So but for me, like, I don't know. I can't see how I can do that in Libra check because of the because it's just set up like a chat.

Emma Balaam
6 minutes 6 seconds6:06
Emma Balaam 6 minutes 6 seconds
Yeah.

Jess Gibbs
6 minutes 7 seconds6:07
Jess Gibbs 6 minutes 7 seconds
It's it's not. There's no. I can't see the extra. Yeah applications in there at the moment, but anyway that will be a discussion for Brenton I think and Matt, OK, what's the next thing? So mock crop data visualisation.
Jess Gibbs 6 minutes 27 seconds
Yeah, that's right.
Jess Gibbs 6 minutes 32 seconds
Probably not so much.
Jess Gibbs 6 minutes 42 seconds
OK, so maybe we could ask to flesh out more of this sort of prompt. Well, I think he's got prompt crafting in the next thing. Actually, I'll just jump into the next section prompt crafting.
Jess Gibbs 6 minutes 56 seconds
So you may be spending a bit of time on that prompting, prompting piece. Nothing in there really needs to change. I don't think good prompting, but for me must say it works.
Jess Gibbs 7 minutes 12 seconds
Yep, again, we just tailor this to say copilot and libre chat or something, whatever it needs to be. It might just for now to be honest, just to be safe because.

Emma Balaam
7 minutes 21 seconds7:21
Emma Balaam 7 minutes 21 seconds
Yeah.

Jess Gibbs
7 minutes 31 seconds7:31
Jess Gibbs 7 minutes 31 seconds
Again.
Jess Gibbs 7 minutes 34 seconds
Probably just making the certain the prompt guide somewhere execute inside.
Jess Gibbs 7 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah, we'd probably need to add. So yeah, some maybe it's a good idea to talk to some of the team around what are some of the things they've thought about asking, you know, what's the model in library? It's.
Jess Gibbs 7 minutes 56 seconds
I think it's Sonnet 4, isn't it? You know, what are some of the things you've tried to ask, but you've got stuck on like maybe we could ask the team if if you if you could, that would be amazing. You know, what is it that you've asked and they don't all have to be work related because it's it's still those people that you know.

Emma Balaam
22 minutes 13 seconds22:13
Emma Balaam 22 minutes 13 seconds
No worries.

Jess Gibbs
22 minutes 28 seconds22:28
Jess Gibbs 22 minutes 28 seconds
Yeah. And if we can get in front of it and if we can see what the wins and the values are, we might be able to get more resources put into being able to help automate as you do so.

Emma Balaam
22 minutes 40 seconds22:40
Emma Balaam 22 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah.

Jess Gibbs
22 minutes 43 seconds22:43
Jess Gibbs 22 minutes 43 seconds
Right. Thank you. Base. Yeah, I'll touch base with you next week. I'm on leave. I'm technically on leave tomorrow, but I will do be doing some work and I'm definitely on leave on Friday.

Emma Balaam
22 minutes 46 seconds22:46
Emma Balaam 22 minutes 46 seconds
No worries. Who?
Emma Balaam 22 minutes 51 seconds
OK.

Jess Gibbs
22 minutes 59 seconds22:59
Jess Gibbs 22 minutes 59 seconds
So yeah, back in next week, you know, I'll put something in our Diaries.

Emma Balaam
23 minutes 3 seconds23:03
Emma Balaam 23 minutes 3 seconds
OK. Sounds good. Alrighty bye.

Jess Gibbs
23 minutes 4 seconds23:04
Jess Gibbs 23 minutes 4 seconds
Awesome. OK, thanks. See ya.
