## 🔧 AI Prompt Playbook for Consultants

**Purpose:** This playbook collects example prompts from the workshop. These are starting points — not because they are perfect, but because they help you think. Use them to prototype ideas, explore workflows, and build toward your own practice.

### ✨ One-Shot Prompt Starters

Quick, direct prompts that deliver a response in a single step.

#### 🔹 Summarise a table

> “You are a junior analyst. Summarise this farm production and financial table. Highlight which crop performed best each year and any concerning trends.”

#### 🔹 Rewrite for a client

> “Rewrite the summary above in plain English for a broadacre farm client. Keep it under 150 words.”

#### 🔹 Create a LinkedIn post

> “Write a short LinkedIn post that summarises this year’s performance. Highlight yields, return on capital, and lessons for other farm businesses.”

#### 🔹 Strategy from data

> “Based on this financial and production summary, provide three strategic options for the next season. Label each option and explain pros/cons.”

#### 🔹 Debate or dual perspectives

> “Respond to this scenario with two voices: one cautious, one aggressive. Summarise their arguments, then provide a synthesis.”

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** These are starting points — not finish lines. Follow up, clarify, and adapt.

### 🗣 Prompting as a Conversation

AI works best when treated like a collaborator, not just a one-shot generator. After your first prompt:

* Ask follow-up questions
* Iterate on the output
* Try role switching: "Now explain it as if I were the client"
* Refine tone, format, or clarity

Think of your prompts as the start of a conversation, not the end.

### ⚙️ Multi-Turn Prompt Chains (Conversational Prompting)

Use prompts like a dialogue — AI is your thinking partner, not just a generator.

#### 🔹 Simulated analyst workflow

1. “Summarise the table.”
2. “What risks do you see in the year-on-year data?”
3. “Now turn this into a section for a client report.”

#### 🔹 Workflow in a single prompt (orchestration style)

> “Read this dataset and market excerpt. Then: 1) Summarise trends, 2) Highlight 3 risks, 3) Suggest 3 strategic responses, 4) Draft a report paragraph. Label each step.”

#### 🔹 Format shifting

> “Turn this report into a newsletter article. Then create a 3-bullet email version and a social post version.”

# 🧠 CRAFT Prompt Patterns for Agricultural Consultants
*Use in Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI tools*

## 📋 CRAFT Formula

**C.R.A.F.T. = Context, Role, Action, Format, Task**

#### 🔹 Full CRAFT prompt

> “This data is from a mixed cropping farm in WA across five seasons. You are a senior farm business advisor. Summarise trends in crop performance, focusing on gross margin and risk. Output in bullet points for an internal strategy document.”

#### 🔹 CRAFT follow-up chain

1. Start with the full prompt above
2. “Now compare this to the previous year’s strategy.”
3. “Summarise changes in less than 100 words for a client call.”




## 📊 Summarise a Table

> “This table contains KPIs for a client’s mixed farm.  
> You are a senior agricultural consultant.  
> Analyse key trends and anomalies.  
> Use bullet points.  
> Focus on margin, yield, and costs.”

---

## 📝 Turn Data into Narrative

> “These KPIs come from a WA broadacre farm.  
> You are writing a report.  
> Summarise performance and suggest one improvement.  
> Format as a paragraph.  
> Focus on production and finance.”

---

## 🎯 Strategy Options

> “Assume low rainfall next year.  
> You are a farm advisor.  
> Suggest 3 strategic options with pros/cons and risk levels.  
> Use a structured list.  
> Focus on grain, inputs, and capital.”

## 🔧 Prompt Modifiers

- “Use plain English”  
- “Add chart suggestions”  
- “Make it sound like advice from a trusted consultant”

### 🎯 Prompt Strategy Patterns

| Pattern                | Description                          | Example Use                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **CRAFT structure**    | Structured, role-based prompting     | Clean first drafts               |
| **Prompt + Follow-up** | Iterative refinement                 | Tone, structure, scope changes   |
| **Multi-role prompts** | Simulate internal/external voices    | Analyst vs. Client vs. Editor    |
| **Reverse prompting**  | Start from goal, build backwards     | "What prompt would create this?" |
| **Template prompts**   | Structured sections with constraints | Risk → Strategy → Outcome        |

### 🔍 Reflection Prompts

> “What’s one part of your job that AI could help with, but you haven’t tried yet?”
> “If you had a digital junior analyst, what would you train it to do first?”
> “What’s a question you ask clients that AI might help explore before the meeting?”

---

### 🏁 Final Thought

> “You don’t need the perfect prompt. You just need to start the conversation. AI will meet you halfway — but only if you bring clarity, curiosity, and a challenge worth solving.”
