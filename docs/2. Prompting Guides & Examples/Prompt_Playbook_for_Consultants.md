## 🔧 AI Prompt Playbook for Teaching Support Officers

**Purpose:** This playbook collects example prompts from the workshop. These are starting points — not because they are perfect, but because they help you think. Use them to prototype ideas, explore workflows, and build toward your own practice.

### ✨ One-Shot Prompt Starters

Quick, direct prompts that deliver a response in a single step.

#### 🔹 Summarise a table

> "You are a Teaching Support Officer. Summarise this student enrolment data table. Highlight which units have capacity issues and any concerning trends in student progression."

#### 🔹 Rewrite for a client

> "Rewrite the summary above in plain English for a faculty board meeting. Keep it under 150 words and focus on actionable insights."

#### 🔹 Create a LinkedIn post

> "Write a brief executive summary that highlights this semester's teaching support achievements. Focus on efficiency gains, compliance improvements, and student satisfaction metrics."

#### 🔹 Strategy from data

> "Based on this enrolment and resource data, provide three strategic options for next semester's unit offerings. Label each option and explain impact on students and resources."

#### 🔹 Debate or dual perspectives

> “Respond to this scenario with two voices: one cautious, one aggressive. Summarise their arguments, then provide a synthesis.”

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** These are starting points — not finish lines. Follow up, clarify, and adapt.

### 🗣 Prompting as a Conversation

AI works best when treated like a collaborator, not just a one-shot generator. After your first prompt:

* Ask follow-up questions
* Iterate on the output
* Try role switching: "Now explain it as if I were the client"
* Refine tone, format, or clarity

Think of your prompts as the start of a conversation, not the end.

### ⚙️ Multi-Turn Prompt Chains (Conversational Prompting)

Use prompts like a dialogue — AI is your thinking partner, not just a generator.

#### 🔹 Simulated analyst workflow

1. “Summarise the table.”
2. “What risks do you see in the year-on-year data?”
3. “Now turn this into a section for a client report.”

#### 🔹 Workflow in a single prompt (orchestration style)

> "Read this course proposal and policy document. Then: 1) Identify compliance requirements, 2) Highlight 3 potential issues, 3) Suggest specific improvements, 4) Draft an executive summary. Label each step."

#### 🔹 Format shifting

> "Turn this impact analysis into a board presentation. Then create a 3-bullet email summary for staff and a brief update for the student portal."

# 🧠 CRAFT Prompt Patterns for Teaching Support Officers
*Use in Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI tools*

## 📋 CRAFT Formula

**C.R.A.F.T. = Context, Role, Action, Format, Task**

#### 🔹 Full CRAFT prompt

> "This data is from Curtin's engineering faculty across three semesters. You are a senior Teaching Support Officer. Summarise trends in unit delivery, focusing on resource utilisation and student outcomes. Output in bullet points for a faculty planning document."

#### 🔹 CRAFT follow-up chain

1. Start with the full prompt above
2. “Now compare this to the previous year’s strategy.”
3. “Summarise changes in less than 100 words for a client call.”




## 📊 Summarise a Table

> "This table contains unit performance metrics for the science faculty.  
> You are a senior Teaching Support Officer.  
> Analyse key trends and anomalies.  
> Use bullet points.  
> Focus on enrolment, completion rates, and resource allocation."

---

## 📝 Turn Data into Narrative

> "These metrics come from Curtin's business school units.  
> You are writing a compliance report.  
> Summarise performance against TEQSA standards and suggest one improvement.  
> Format as a paragraph.  
> Focus on student outcomes and teaching quality."

---

## 🎯 Strategy Options

> "Assume 15% budget reduction next year.  
> You are a Teaching Support Officer.  
> Suggest 3 strategic options for maintaining teaching quality with pros/cons and risk levels.  
> Use a structured list.  
> Focus on unit consolidation, delivery modes, and staff allocation."

## 🔧 Prompt Modifiers

- “Use plain English”  
- “Add chart suggestions”  
- "Make it sound like advice from an experienced Teaching Support Officer"

### 🎯 Prompt Strategy Patterns

| Pattern                | Description                          | Example Use                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **CRAFT structure**    | Structured, role-based prompting     | Clean first drafts               |
| **Prompt + Follow-up** | Iterative refinement                 | Tone, structure, scope changes   |
| **Multi-role prompts** | Simulate internal/external voices    | TSO vs. Faculty vs. Students     |
| **Reverse prompting**  | Start from goal, build backwards     | "What prompt would create this?" |
| **Template prompts**   | Structured sections with constraints | Risk → Strategy → Outcome        |

### 🔍 Reflection Prompts

> "What's one part of your TSO role that AI could help with, but you haven't tried yet?"
> "If you had a digital teaching support assistant, what would you train it to do first?"
> "What's a compliance check or data analysis that AI could prepare before faculty meetings?"

### 🏁 Final Thought

> “You don’t need the perfect prompt. You just need to start the conversation. AI will meet you halfway — but only if you bring clarity, curiosity, and a challenge worth solving.”
