## 🧩 1:30–1:45 — Personal AI Challenge

### 🎯 Purpose

Give participants space to apply what they’ve learned in a personal, meaningful way. Encourage experimentation, reflection, and confidence-building through self-directed prompt design.

---

### 🧠 Challenge Setup

> “You’ve seen one-shot prompts. You’ve seen collaborative chains. You’ve seen CRAFT. Now let’s flip it around: what’s a task you do often — or wish you could do — that we haven’t covered?”

Participants choose one of:

* A **real task** they perform in Excel, Word, Teams, or Outlook
* A **reporting or writing challenge** (summaries, strategy, risk, benchmarking)
* A **client question** they regularly field

Then:

* Use CRAFT to structure their **first prompt**
* Write a **follow-up prompt** to improve or adapt it
* (Optional) Try the same idea in two tools (ChatGPT + Copilot, etc.)

### 📝 Personal Worksheet Prompts

> 1. What’s the task or challenge you’re exploring?
> 2. Write your first CRAFT-style prompt.
> 3. What did you like or not like about the AI’s response?
> 4. What prompt could improve or refine the result?
> 5. How might this workflow become part of your routine?

---

### 🗣 Share & Reflect

Ask for 1–2 volunteers to share:

* Their original task
* Their AI output (summarised)
* Their revised or improved prompt

Facilitator can highlight:

* Prompt refinement as thinking, not correcting
* Collaboration over automation
* Tool fit: what works best where

### 🏁 Takeaway

> “This is where the real shift happens: not just using AI for the tasks I already do, but discovering how it can help me think, improve, and explore new possibilities. One prompt at a time.”
