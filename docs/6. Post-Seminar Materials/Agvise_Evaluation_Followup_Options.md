## 📊 Evaluation & Follow-Up Options — Agvise AI Seminar

### ✅ Session Focus Recap

This session was designed to meet Agvise’s goals of exploring AI-enhanced workflows for internal efficiency and client-facing value. Rather than teaching isolated tasks, we focused on:

* **Using AI as a collaborator**, not a shortcut
* **Structured prompt strategies** (CRAFT + chaining)
* **Mock reporting workflows** simulating Excel → Word pipelines
* **Safe experimentation** using mock/public data only
* **Sustainable and secure adoption** through Copilot, not ChatGPT alone

### 🚀 Follow-Up Options

If the team would benefit from continued support, consider one or more of the following:

#### 🔁 1. *Prompt to Process* Workshop

> Turn structured prompt chains into **automated workflows** using n8n, Power Automate, or Zapier.

* Live build: spreadsheet drop ➝ summary ➝ email draft
* Hosted securely using mock data or sandbox environments

#### 🛠 2. Copilot Integration Working Session

> A guided session mapping current Word/Excel workflows to Copilot functionality

* What’s ready to automate now?
* What still needs human judgement?

#### 📚 3. AI Adoption Brief or Playbook

> A custom internal resource outlining:

* Prompts that work in your team
* Where Copilot fits in your stack
* Do’s & don’ts for secure AI use

### 💬 Feedback & Next Steps

> We’d love your thoughts:

* What resonated?
* What needs more depth next time?
* Would follow-up training on automation tools be useful?

Please reach out to Michael Borck or Curtin ExecEd with any ideas or requests.

### 🏁 Final Thought

> “You don’t need to build everything today. But every prompt you refine, every workflow you explore — that’s a step toward smarter, more strategic use of AI in your business.”
