## 📊 Evaluation & Follow-Up Options — TSO AI Literacy Program

### ✅ Session Focus Recap

This session was designed to meet the Teaching Support Officers' goals of exploring AI-enhanced workflows for operational efficiency and strategic impact. Rather than teaching isolated tasks, we focused on:

* **Using AI as a collaborator** to enhance TSO capabilities
* **Structured prompt strategies** (CRAFT + chaining) for compliance and analysis
* **Mock university workflows** including business cases, impact analysis, and data consolidation
* **Safe experimentation** using mock student data only
* **Sustainable and secure adoption** aligned with Curtin policies
