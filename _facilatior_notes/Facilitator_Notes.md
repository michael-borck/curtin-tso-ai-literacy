### **Agenda Breakdown & Facilitator Script:**

#### **🧭 0:00–0:10 — Welcome & Framing**

-   **Purpose:** Set the tone, position AI as a partner, and introduce the seminar's core questions.
    
-   **Key Message:** "AI isn't here to replace your judgment — it’s here to reduce your keyboard time."
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **👋 Welcome & Context:**
        
        -   "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. I'm Michael Borck, and I'm excited to spend the next two hours exploring how AI can genuinely enhance your work as consultants."
            
        -   "You are the experts in agricultural consulting. My role today is to show you what AI can do _with_ that expertise, not replace it."
            
        -   "We'll focus on practical applications and how AI integrates with tools you might already be using."
            
    -   **🤖 Why AI — and Why Now?:**
        
        -   "The landscape of work is changing rapidly. AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it's integrated into tools like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams."
            
        -   "The core idea is simple: AI is incredibly fast and increasingly reliable at handling **repetitive** tasks. This frees you up for more **valuable**, judgment-intensive work."
            
        -   "But, and this is crucial, AI isn’t perfect. It needs your **context**, your **expertise**, and your **guidance**."
            
    -   **🚀 What’s Now Possible That Wasn’t Before?:**
        
        -   "Let's think big for a moment. What tasks have you, or Agvise as a whole, avoided doing because they were too time-consuming, too expensive, or just seemed impossible for a single client?"
            
        -   _Pause for a moment, let them reflect._
            
        -   "AI is making some of those 'too hard' jobs suddenly realistic: personalized advice at scale, automating complex report sections, exploring client-specific 'what-if' scenarios, or even turning your internal SOPs into searchable Q&A systems."
            
    -   **❓ Two Guiding Questions for the Seminar:**
        
        -   _Write clearly on whiteboard/digital canvas:_
            
            1.  **"How can we automate what we already do?"**
                
            2.  **"What could we never do — until now?"**
                
        -   "These two questions will be our compass throughout this seminar. Keep them in mind as we explore the tools and techniques."
            
    -   **🧠 Tone to Set:**
        
        -   "This session is designed to be **interactive** and **imaginative**. It's a space for exploration, not perfection."
            
        -   "It's okay to be skeptical; in fact, healthy skepticism is vital. But I encourage you to also be curious. We're not aiming to master AI today, but to start _thinking differently_ about what it can do."
            

#### **⚙️ 0:10–0:30 — Automate the Tedious**

-   **Purpose:** Demonstrate AI's ability to handle repetitive tasks in familiar tools, evolving from basic to more complex prompting.
    
-   **Key Message:** "AI isn’t just for answering questions — it can draft, reword, restructure, and _simulate how you think_. We’re not just automating what we do — we’re multiplying what we can deliver.”
    
-   **Live Demo Setup:**
    
    -   Ensure you have `mock_crop_data.csv` ready.
        
    -   Have your chosen LLM (Copilot Chat in Word/Excel web is ideal for relevance, otherwise ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) open and ready.
        
    -   _Remind participants that these are mock data examples to demonstrate functionality, not real client data._
        
-   **Framing:**
    
    -   "Let’s be honest — a lot of time is spent copying, pasting, rewording, and formatting. These are things that don’t require judgment — but they do require time. AI can help us take these off the plate."
        
    -   _Reiterate the two guiding questions from the previous segment._
        
-   **Demo Walkthrough (follow prompts from `agvise_automate_the_tedious_full.md`):**
    
    -   **✅ DEMO 1: Summarise Mock Crop Data**
        
        -   _Open `mock_crop_data.csv` (or paste its content into the LLM if using a general chat tool)._
            
        -   **Prompt 1:** "You are a junior analyst. Summarise this farm production and financial table. Highlight which crop performed best each year and any concerning trends."
            
        -   _Discuss the initial output – what's good, what could be better?_
            
        -   **Follow-Up Prompt:** "Now rewrite that summary for a broadacre WA farm client in plain English."
            
        -   **📌 Highlight:** Show how a simple follow-up prompt refines tone and audience. This is about _value-added rewriting_.
            
    -   **✅ DEMO 2: Turn Insights into Content**
        
        -   _Take the refined summary from Demo 1._
            
        -   **Prompt:** "Using the summary above, create a LinkedIn post highlighting farm performance and grain yield outcomes in 2023."
            
        -   _Discuss the output._
            
        -   **Variation Prompt (don't execute, just mention):** "Write this as a newsletter article with subheadings and 3 key takeaways."
            
        -   **📌 Highlight:** Emphasize how one core insight can be repurposed for multiple platforms/audiences with minimal effort.
            
    -   **✅ DEMO 3: Reason Like a Consultant (Prompt Chain)**
        
        -   _This demonstrates iterative refinement and role-playing._
            
        -   **Prompt Chain (execute step-by-step):**
            
            1.  "Act as a junior analyst: summarise \[paste mock data again or refer to previous summary\]."
                
            2.  "Act as a senior consultant: critique the summary \[refer to the junior analyst's summary\]."
                
            3.  "Merge both into a final report section."
                
        -   **📌 Highlight:** Show the power of layered prompting and simulating different roles for critical thinking.
            
    -   **✅ DEMO 4: Prompt as Workflow (Agent Logic)**
        
        -   _This is a more advanced concept, showing how a single prompt can orchestrate multiple tasks._
            
        -   **Prompt:** "Read this data and a short market summary. Then: 1) summarise trends, 2) highlight 3 risks, 3) write strategy suggestions, and 4) draft a report paragraph. Label each step."
            
        -   _Use `mock_crop_data.csv` and a brief, generic market summary (e.g., "Grain prices saw a slight dip in Q4 2023 due to increased global supply, but demand remains stable for premium varieties."). Make sure to clearly label the sections in the output._
            
        -   **📌 Highlight:** This shows AI performing a mini-workflow, simulating agent-like behavior.
            
    -   **🛠 Optional Prompt Enhancers (Discuss, don't necessarily demo all):**
        
        -   "Use plain English suitable for farm clients."
            
        -   "Structure as a summary with headings."
            
        -   "Limit to 100 words per section."
            
        -   "Write like a trusted Agvise consultant."
            
-   **Discussion Prompt (`agvise_review_first_two_agenda_items.md` suggests a tailored prompt):**
    
    -   "Which parts of your **reporting process** could this help with?"
        
    -   "Where might AI reduce your **time-to-insight** without sacrificing accuracy?"
        
    -   _Encourage participants to share specific examples from their work._
        
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "AI isn’t just for answering questions — it can draft, reword, restructure, and _simulate how you think_. We’re not just automating what we do — we’re multiplying what we can deliver."
        

#### **🔨 0:30–0:45 — Prompt Crafting with CRAFT**

-   **Purpose:** Teach participants a structured framework (CRAFT) for writing effective prompts.
    
-   **Key Message:** "CRAFT isn’t just for writing better prompts — it’s a way to start better conversations with AI. Think of it like briefing a capable colleague, not commanding a tool. It works best when you build on it turn by turn."
    
-   **Handout:** `CRAFT_Prompting_Framework.md`
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **💡 Why It Matters:**
        
        -   "Most disappointing AI results aren't because the AI is bad, but because the prompt was vague or lacked context."
            
        -   "Structured prompts lead to better, more relevant outputs with less rework."
            
        -   "The beauty of CRAFT is that it's platform-agnostic – it works whether you're using ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, or Claude."
            
        -   "Think of prompting like a briefing: the better you brief the AI, the better its draft. And remember, the first prompt is rarely the final answer. Good prompts invite a **conversation**, not just a command."
            
    -   **🧠 C.R.A.F.T Framework:**
        
        -   _Walk through each element of CRAFT, using the examples from `CRAFT_Prompting_Framework.md`._
            
        -   **C** = **Context**: "What background info does the AI need? (e.g., 'This data is from a WA mixed farm over 5 years.')"
            
        -   **R** = **Role**: "Who should the AI pretend to be? (e.g., 'You are a senior ag consultant.')"
            
        -   **A** = **Action**: "What do you want the AI to _do_? (e.g., 'Summarise the financial trends.')"
            
        -   **F** = **Format**: "How should the output be structured? (e.g., 'Write in bullet points.')"
            
        -   **T** = **Tone/Target**: "What's the desired tone or audience? (e.g., 'Use plain English for the farm owner.')"
            
        -   "You don’t have to use every element every time — but this gives you the scaffolding."
            
    -   **🛠 DEMO: Improving a Prompt with CRAFT:**
        
        -   _Use the "Original Prompt" and "Improved Prompt" example from the handout._
            
        -   **Original Prompt:** "What happened with grain yields?"
            
        -   **Improved Prompt:** "This is yield data from a wheat and barley farm in WA over five seasons. You are an experienced farm business advisor. Summarise the yield trends and note any volatility. Output in three bullet points using plain English for the farm owner."
            
        -   _Show the difference in output quality (if possible, by running both in your LLM)._
            
    -   **🗣 Prompting as a Conversation:**
        
        -   "CRAFT is a great **starting point** — but don't stop there. One-shot prompting can feel transactional. The real power is in **using AI as a collaborator**."
            
        -   "Think of CRAFT as your first message to a new colleague. The next steps are to discuss, clarify, iterate."
            
        -   **Example Chain (reiterate from previous section, or quickly demo one):**
            
            1.  "Craft a CRAFT-style summary prompt."
                
            2.  "Follow up: 'Add any year-on-year risks you see.'"
                
            3.  "Follow up: 'Now restructure that for a client newsletter.'"
                
        -   "You’re not just prompting. You’re **working together.**"
            
    -   **🔁 Practice Exercise (Interactive):**
        
        -   "Now it's your turn. Take a short paragraph or summary (either from your own work or a generic example you have ready)."
            
        -   "Your task is to rewrite a basic prompt for it using the CRAFT structure."
            
        -   "Then, think of a follow-up prompt to adapt the result for another audience."
            
        -   _Give them 3-5 minutes to work individually or in pairs._
            
        -   _Invite 1-2 participants to share their original task, their CRAFT prompt, and their follow-up idea._
            
        -   **Facilitator Highlight:** Emphasize how **prompting evolves across turns** and how adding context and specificity improves results.
            
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "CRAFT isn’t just for writing better prompts — it’s a way to start better conversations with AI. Think of it like briefing a capable colleague, not commanding a tool. It works best when you build on it turn by turn."
        

#### **☕ 0:45–0:55 — Break**

-   **Purpose:** Provide a short break for participants.
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   "Time for a quick break! Grab some tea or coffee, stretch your legs."
        
    -   _Optional: Write on whiteboard/digital canvas:_ "What _hasn’t_ AI helped you with — yet?" _This can serve as a thought-starter for the next segment._
        

#### **🌟 0:55–1:15 — Unlocking the Impossible**

-   **Purpose:** Shift mindset from automation to capability expansion, showcasing tasks previously difficult or impossible.
    
-   **Key Message:** "Automation is good. But transformation is better. The real power of AI is doing things you couldn’t do before. This is where competitive advantage lives."
    
-   **Handout:** `AI_Unlocking_Impossible_Tasks.md`
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **💡 Framing Statement:**
        
        -   "So far, we’ve looked at how to automate what you already do. Now let’s ask a better question: What have you never been able to do because it felt too hard, too slow, or too expensive? AI may now make those things possible."
            
    -   **🧠 Examples of "Impossible" Tasks AI Can Now Tackle:**
        
        -   _Go through the table in the handout, providing brief, real-world examples for each._
            
        -   **Market synthesis:** "Imagine quickly digesting 5+ market reports to extract key insights, not just summaries."
            
        -   **Report repurposing:** "Turning a detailed annual report into a concise client email, a LinkedIn post, and a blog article, all in minutes."
            
        -   **Internal Q&A:** "New staff asking complex policy questions and getting instant, cited answers from your internal SOPs."
            
        -   **Competing viewpoints:** "Having AI simulate a debate between a cautious and an aggressive investment strategy for a client, showing pros and cons for each."
            
        -   **Strategic what-ifs:** "Exploring multiple 'what-if' scenarios for a farm's future without spending days building complex spreadsheets."
            
    -   **🤖 Live Demo: NotebookLM (if access is available)**
        
        -   "Now, I want to show you a tool that truly embodies this 'unlocking the impossible' idea: Google's NotebookLM."
            
        -   "Imagine having an AI that knows _your_ documents — and cites them. Instead of re-reading a 50-page policy document, what if you could _ask_ it questions?"
            
        -   _Walkthrough (as per `AI_Unlocking_Impossible_Tasks.md`):_
            
            -   "I'll upload some sample SOPs and past reports (mock data, of course)."
                
            -   "Then, I can ask: 'Summarise how we advise on debt management based on these documents.'"
                
            -   "Or: 'What has changed in our approach to risk assessment over the last 3 years, according to these reports?'"
                
        -   **📌 Emphasize:**
            
            -   "This tool is not for client data (yet) – but it's perfect for internal playbooks, onboarding new staff, ensuring consistency, and rapidly reusing your firm's collective knowledge."
                
            -   "NotebookLM is like ChatGPT for your firm’s documents — but traceable and referenceable."
                
    -   **🧠 Discussion Prompt:**
        
        -   "What’s something you’ve _wanted_ to do for clients, but never had the time or tools for?"
            
        -   "What would a junior analyst, working 24/7 and able to read anything instantly, let you do more of?"
            
        -   _Encourage sharing and brainstorming._
            
    -   **✅ Optional Micro-Exercise: Reverse Prompt (if time allows, or assign as homework)**
        
        -   "Think of a task you've never had time for. Now, try to write a prompt that _tries_ to do that thing. What happens?"
            
        -   _Example: "Write a benchmarking summary comparing this year’s farm performance to 3 previous seasons. Highlight weather-adjusted yield impact and price trends."_
            
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "Automation is good. But transformation is better. The real power of AI is doing things you couldn’t do before. This is where competitive advantage lives."
        

#### **🔒 1:15–1:30 — Secure & Sustainable AI Use**

-   **Purpose:** Ground the seminar in responsible AI use, building confidence in secure practices.
    
-   **Key Message:** "AI is only as smart as your context — and only as safe as your systems. Work with it like a colleague: trust it, but verify, and never put it in a position to break the rules.”
    
-   **Handout:** `Secure_Sustainable_AI_Use.md`
    
-   **Handout:** `AI_Core_Tensions_Handout.md` (for deeper reflection)
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **📄 Framing Statement:**
        
        -   "Even if the AI gets the right answer, if you use the wrong data or tool, it can create serious risk. Let’s talk about what’s safe, what’s smart, and what’s sustainable in your setting."
            
    -   **🔍 Key Principles (go through each point in the handout):**
        
        1.  **Use mock or public data in all experiments:** "Especially with public tools like ChatGPT. Never use real client data here."
            
        2.  **Assume anything entered into a public AI chat is public:** "Unless you have explicit enterprise agreements, treat it as a public forum."
            
        3.  **Use your secure platforms for sensitive work:** "Copilot within Microsoft 365 is enterprise-grade. Your data stays within your tenant and is _not_ used to train public models. This is critical for Agvise."
            
        4.  **Prototype in chat tools, deploy in secure environments:** "Think of public AI as your sandbox for prompt engineering. Once you have a working workflow, move it to a secure environment like Copilot, or even automation tools like Zapier or n8n if appropriate."
            
        5.  **Governance is a team sport:** "Involve your IT and security teams. Keep logs of how AI is used, version your prompts, and understand data access."
            
    -   **🚧 Platform Governance Comparison:**
        
        -   _Briefly discuss the table in the handout, emphasizing the distinction between public and enterprise-grade tools._
            
        -   "**ChatGPT/Claude:** Great for rapid prototyping with mock data. **Never** for client-sensitive information."
            
        -   "**Copilot Chat (in M365):** Your go-to for internal and client-facing work. It respects your existing permissions and data security."
            
        -   "**Gemini:** Use with caution, verify its data handling policies for your specific use case."
            
    -   **🚀 Strategy Summary: Prompt, Process, Protect:**
        
        -   "To summarize our approach to responsible AI use:"
            
            1.  **Prompt It:** "Use AI chat to test your thinking, summarise ideas, and shape workflows."
                
            2.  **Process It:** "Move successful chains into tools like Copilot, n8n, or Zapier."
                
            3.  **Protect It:** "When it’s sensitive or client-facing, work within secure systems."
                
    -   **🚶 What to Say if Asked: “Can we use this for real clients?”**
        
        -   "Yes, but only in tools governed by your enterprise environment — like Copilot in Microsoft 365. You can prototype freely in public AI, but don’t use client data outside secure systems."
            
    -   **🤔 Discussion (refer to `AI_Core_Tensions_Handout.md`):**
        
        -   "AI introduces some core tensions. Let's look at the 'Thinking vs. Replacing' or 'Speed vs. Safety' sections in your handout. What challenges do you foresee in balancing these in your daily work?"
            
        -   _Encourage a brief discussion on practical implications._
            
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "AI is only as smart as your context — and only as safe as your systems. Work with it like a colleague: trust it, but verify, and never put it in a position to break the rules.”
        

#### **🧩 1:30–1:45 — Personal AI Challenge**

-   **Purpose:** Provide a hands-on, personalized activity to apply learned concepts and build confidence.
    
-   **Key Message:** "This is where the real shift happens: not just using AI for the tasks I already do, but discovering how it can help me think, improve, and explore new possibilities. One prompt at a time."
    
-   **Handout:** `Personal_AI_Challenge_Worksheet.md`
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **🧠 Challenge Setup:**
        
        -   "You’ve seen one-shot prompts. You’ve seen collaborative chains. You’ve seen CRAFT. Now let’s flip it around: what’s a task you do often — or wish you could do — that we haven’t covered?"
            
        -   "Your task is to fill out the 'Personal AI Challenge Worksheet'."
            
        -   **Participants choose one:**
            
            -   A **real task** they perform in Excel, Word, Teams, or Outlook.
                
            -   A **reporting or writing challenge** (summaries, strategy, risk, benchmarking).
                
            -   A **client question** they regularly field.
                
        -   **Then, on the worksheet:**
            
            -   "Identify the task/challenge."
                
            -   "Write your **first CRAFT-style prompt** for it."
                
            -   "Choose which tool you'd try (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM)."
                
            -   "Define what success would look like for this task."
                
            -   "If you have time, try running your prompt in your chosen tool and note the results."
                
        -   _Give participants 10-12 minutes to work on this individually._
            
        -   _Circulate around the room to offer one-on-one support and answer questions._
            
    -   **🗣 Share & Reflect:**
        
        -   "Let's bring it back together. Would 1-2 volunteers be willing to share their challenge and what they experienced?"
            
        -   _If someone shares, guide the discussion:_
            
            -   "What was the original task?"
                
            -   "What was the AI's output like (briefly summarize)?"
                
            -   "What was your revised or improved prompt (if applicable)?"
                
        -   **Facilitator Highlight:**
            
            -   "Notice how prompt refinement is a form of thinking, not just correcting."
                
            -   "This is about collaboration, not just automation."
                
            -   "Consider how the choice of tool fits the task."
                
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "This is where the real shift happens: not just using AI for the tasks I already do, but discovering how it can help me think, improve, and explore new possibilities. One prompt at a time."
