### **Agenda Breakdown & Facilitator Script:**

#### **üß≠ 0:00‚Äì0:10 ‚Äî Welcome & Framing**

-   **Purpose:** Set the tone, position AI as a partner, and introduce the seminar's core questions.
    
-   **Key Message:** "AI isn't here to replace your judgment ‚Äî it‚Äôs here to reduce your keyboard time."
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **üëã Welcome & Context:**
        
        -   "Good morning/afternoon, everyone. I'm Michael Borck, and I'm excited to spend the next two hours exploring how AI can genuinely enhance your work as Teaching Support Officers."
            
        -   "You are the experts in teaching support and university operations. My role today is to show you what AI can do _with_ that expertise, not replace it."
            
        -   "We'll focus on practical applications and how AI integrates with tools you might already be using."
            
    -   **ü§ñ Why AI ‚Äî and Why Now?:**
        
        -   "The landscape of work is changing rapidly. AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it's integrated into tools like Word, Excel, Outlook, and Teams."
            
        -   "The core idea is simple: AI is incredibly fast and increasingly reliable at handling **repetitive** tasks. This frees you up for more **valuable**, judgment-intensive work."
            
        -   "But, and this is crucial, AI isn‚Äôt perfect. It needs your **context**, your **expertise**, and your **guidance**."
            
    -   **üöÄ What‚Äôs Now Possible That Wasn‚Äôt Before?:**
        
        -   "Let's think big for a moment. What tasks have you, or your faculty as a whole, avoided doing because they were too time-consuming, too expensive, or just seemed impossible for teaching support?"
            
        -   _Pause for a moment, let them reflect._
            
        -   "AI is making some of those 'too hard' jobs suddenly realistic: automated compliance checking at scale, intelligent impact analysis for course changes, proactive support planning, or even turning university policies into searchable Q&A systems."
            
    -   **‚ùì Two Guiding Questions for the Seminar:**
        
        -   _Write clearly on whiteboard/digital canvas:_
            
            1.  **"How can we automate what we already do?"**
                
            2.  **"What could we never do ‚Äî until now?"**
                
        -   "These two questions will be our compass throughout this seminar. Keep them in mind as we explore the tools and techniques."
            
    -   **üß† Tone to Set:**
        
        -   "This session is designed to be **interactive** and **imaginative**. It's a space for exploration, not perfection."
            
        -   "It's okay to be skeptical; in fact, healthy skepticism is vital. But I encourage you to also be curious. We're not aiming to master AI today, but to start _thinking differently_ about what it can do."
            

#### **‚öôÔ∏è 0:10‚Äì0:30 ‚Äî Automating Our Core Work: From Hours to Minutes**

-   **Purpose:** Demonstrate AI's ability to handle repetitive teaching support tasks, particularly around compliance documentation and impact analysis.
    
-   **Key Message:** "AI isn't just for answering questions ‚Äî it can draft business cases, check compliance, analyze impacts, and consolidate data. We're not just automating what we do ‚Äî we're enhancing our strategic value."
    
-   **Live Demo Setup:**
    
    -   Ensure you have `tso_mock_unit_data.csv` ready.
        
    -   Have your chosen LLM (Copilot Chat in Word/Excel web is ideal for relevance, otherwise ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) open and ready.
        
    -   _Remind participants that these are mock data examples to demonstrate functionality, not real student data._
        
-   **Framing:**
    
    -   "Let's be honest ‚Äî a lot of time is spent on repetitive compliance checks, reformatting documentation, and manual data collection. These tasks consume hours that could be spent on strategic support planning. AI can automate these processes."
        
    -   _Reiterate the two guiding questions from the previous segment._
        
-   **Demo Walkthrough (follow prompts from `tso_automate_the_tedious_full.md`):**
    
    -   **‚úÖ DEMO 1: Smart Business Case Generator**
        
        -   _Open `tso_mock_unit_data.csv` (or paste its content into the LLM if using a general chat tool)._
            
        -   **Prompt 1:** "You are a Teaching Support Officer writing a business case for a new course. The proposal is in my rough notes. Draft a formal business case, ensuring it addresses all requirements outlined in Curtin's course approval policy and TEQSA guidelines."
            
        -   _Discuss the initial output ‚Äì what's good, what could be better?_
            
        -   **Follow-Up Prompt:** "Now, flag any potential compliance gaps and suggest specific wording to ensure the document is ready for the faculty board."
            
        -   **üìå Highlight:** This demonstrates immediate time savings and a direct link to the 'Quick Win' pilot project.
            
    -   **‚úÖ DEMO 2: Intelligent Impact Analysis**
        
        -   _Take the unit data from Demo 1._
            
        -   **Prompt:** "The faculty is proposing to retire units X, Y, and Z. Using the provided (mock) student enrollment data, analyze which student cohorts are affected, suggest alternative pathways, and generate a summary table and chart for a board meeting."
            
        -   _Discuss the output._
            
        -   **Variation Prompt (don't execute, just mention):** "Now create a risk assessment highlighting any students who might not graduate on time due to these changes."
            
        -   **üìå Highlight:** This showcases the 'Strategic Win' and positions AI as a tool for more informed decision-making.
            
    -   **‚úÖ DEMO 3: Automated Data Workflow**
        
        -   _This demonstrates consolidating data from multiple sources._
            
        -   **Prompt:** "I have received three separate emails with semester availability for ENGR1001, PHYS2002, and MATH101. Extract the key information (unit, semester, tutorial count, quota) and consolidate it into a single table. Flag any potential timetable conflicts."
            
        -   _Discuss the output - how it saves time on manual data collection._
            
        -   **Follow-Up:** "Generate a formatted report for the timetabling committee with recommendations for conflict resolution."
                
        -   **üìå Highlight:** This addresses the 'Operational Win' and demonstrates how AI can reduce the stress of manual data collection.
            
    -   **‚úÖ DEMO 4: Prompt as Workflow (Agent Logic)**
        
        -   _This is a more advanced concept, showing how a single prompt can orchestrate multiple tasks._
            
        -   **Prompt:** "Review this course proposal against Curtin's policies. Then: 1) identify compliance requirements, 2) highlight any gaps, 3) suggest specific improvements, and 4) draft an executive summary. Label each step."
            
        -   _Use `tso_mock_unit_data.csv` and a brief course proposal excerpt. Make sure to clearly label the sections in the output._
            
        -   **üìå Highlight:** Single prompt ‚Üí comprehensive compliance review (agent-like behavior).
            
    -   **üõ† Optional Prompt Enhancers (Discuss, don't necessarily demo all):**
        
        -   "Use clear language suitable for faculty board presentations."
            
        -   "Structure as an executive summary with actionable recommendations."
            
        -   "Include compliance references to TEQSA standards."
            
        -   "Write like an experienced Teaching Support Officer."
            
-   **Discussion Prompt (`tso_review_first_two_agenda_items.md` suggests a tailored prompt):**
    
    -   "Which parts of your **TSO workflow** could benefit most from AI automation?"
        
    -   "Where might AI help you move from **reactive to proactive** support planning?"
        
    -   _Encourage participants to share specific examples from their work._
        
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "AI isn't just for answering questions ‚Äî it can draft business cases, check compliance, analyze impacts, and consolidate data. We're not just automating what we do ‚Äî we're enhancing our strategic value."
        

#### **üî® 0:30‚Äì0:45 ‚Äî Prompt Crafting with CRAFT**

-   **Purpose:** Teach participants a structured framework (CRAFT) for writing effective prompts.
    
-   **Key Message:** "CRAFT isn‚Äôt just for writing better prompts ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to start better conversations with AI. Think of it like briefing a capable colleague, not commanding a tool. It works best when you build on it turn by turn."
    
-   **Handout:** `CRAFT_Prompting_Framework.md`
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **üí° Why It Matters:**
        
        -   "Most disappointing AI results aren't because the AI is bad, but because the prompt was vague or lacked context."
            
        -   "Structured prompts lead to better, more relevant outputs with less rework."
            
        -   "The beauty of CRAFT is that it's platform-agnostic ‚Äì it works whether you're using ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, or Claude."
            
        -   "Think of prompting like a briefing: the better you brief the AI, the better its draft. And remember, the first prompt is rarely the final answer. Good prompts invite a **conversation**, not just a command."
            
    -   **üß† C.R.A.F.T Framework:**
        
        -   _Walk through each element of CRAFT, using the examples from `CRAFT_Prompting_Framework.md`._
            
        -   **C** = **Context**: "What background info does the AI need? (e.g., 'This data is from Curtin engineering units over 3 semesters.')"
            
        -   **R** = **Role**: "Who should the AI pretend to be? (e.g., 'You are a senior Teaching Support Officer.')"
            
        -   **A** = **Action**: "What do you want the AI to _do_? (e.g., 'Analyse enrollment trends and resource utilization.')"
            
        -   **F** = **Format**: "How should the output be structured? (e.g., 'Write in bullet points.')"
            
        -   **T** = **Tone/Target**: "What's the desired tone or audience? (e.g., 'Use clear language for a faculty board presentation.')"
            
        -   "You don‚Äôt have to use every element every time ‚Äî but this gives you the scaffolding."
            
    -   **üõ† DEMO: Improving a Prompt with CRAFT:**
        
        -   _Use the "Original Prompt" and "Improved Prompt" example from the handout._
            
        -   **Original Prompt:** "What's happening with student numbers?"
            
        -   **Improved Prompt:** "This is enrollment data from engineering units at Curtin over three semesters. You are an experienced Teaching Support Officer. Analyse the enrollment trends and identify any units at risk of low numbers. Output in three bullet points using clear language for the faculty board."
            
        -   _Show the difference in output quality (if possible, by running both in your LLM)._
            
    -   **üó£ Prompting as a Conversation:**
        
        -   "CRAFT is a great **starting point** ‚Äî but don't stop there. One-shot prompting can feel transactional. The real power is in **using AI as a collaborator**."
            
        -   "Think of CRAFT as your first message to a new colleague. The next steps are to discuss, clarify, iterate."
            
        -   **Example Chain (reiterate from previous section, or quickly demo one):**
            
            1.  "Craft a CRAFT-style summary prompt."
                
            2.  "Follow up: 'Add any year-on-year risks you see.'"
                
            3.  "Follow up: 'Now restructure that for a faculty update.'"
                
        -   "You‚Äôre not just prompting. You‚Äôre **working together.**"
            
    -   **üîÅ Practice Exercise (Interactive):**
        
        -   "Now it's your turn. Take a short paragraph or summary (either from your own work or a generic example you have ready)."
            
        -   "Your task is to rewrite a basic prompt for it using the CRAFT structure."
            
        -   "Then, think of a follow-up prompt to adapt the result for another audience."
            
        -   _Give them 3-5 minutes to work individually or in pairs._
            
        -   _Invite 1-2 participants to share their original task, their CRAFT prompt, and their follow-up idea._
            
        -   **Facilitator Highlight:** Emphasize how **prompting evolves across turns** and how adding context and specificity improves results.
            
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "CRAFT isn‚Äôt just for writing better prompts ‚Äî it‚Äôs a way to start better conversations with AI. Think of it like briefing a capable colleague, not commanding a tool. It works best when you build on it turn by turn."
        

#### **‚òï 0:45‚Äì0:55 ‚Äî Break**

-   **Purpose:** Provide a short break for participants.
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   "Time for a quick break! Grab some tea or coffee, stretch your legs."
        
    -   _Optional: Write on whiteboard/digital canvas:_ "What _hasn‚Äôt_ AI helped you with ‚Äî yet?" _This can serve as a thought-starter for the next segment._
        

#### **üåü 0:55‚Äì1:15 ‚Äî Unlocking the Impossible**

-   **Purpose:** Shift mindset from automation to capability expansion, showcasing tasks previously difficult or impossible.
    
-   **Key Message:** "Automation is good. But transformation is better. The real power of AI is doing things you couldn‚Äôt do before. This is where competitive advantage lives."
    
-   **Handout:** `AI_Unlocking_Impossible_Tasks.md`
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **üí° Framing Statement:**
        
        -   "So far, we‚Äôve looked at how to automate what you already do. Now let‚Äôs ask a better question: What have you never been able to do because it felt too hard, too slow, or too expensive? AI may now make those things possible."
            
    -   **üß† Examples of "Impossible" Tasks AI Can Now Tackle:**
        
        -   _Go through the table in the handout, providing brief, real-world examples for each._
            
        -   **Market synthesis:** "Imagine quickly digesting 5+ market reports to extract key insights, not just summaries."
            
        -   **Report repurposing:** "Turning a detailed annual report into a concise faculty email, a website update, and a board presentation, all in minutes."
            
        -   **Internal Q&A:** "New staff asking complex policy questions and getting instant, cited answers from your internal SOPs."
            
        -   **Competing viewpoints:** "Having AI simulate a debate between different approaches to unit consolidation or delivery modes, showing pros and cons for each."
            
        -   **Strategic what-ifs:** "Exploring multiple 'what-if' scenarios for course changes and student impact without spending days building complex spreadsheets."
            
    -   **ü§ñ Live Demo: NotebookLM (if access is available)**
        
        -   "Now, I want to show you a tool that truly embodies this 'unlocking the impossible' idea: Google's NotebookLM."
            
        -   "Imagine having an AI that knows _your_ documents ‚Äî and cites them. Instead of re-reading a 50-page policy document, what if you could _ask_ it questions?"
            
        -   _Walkthrough (as per `AI_Unlocking_Impossible_Tasks.md`):_
            
            -   "I'll upload some sample SOPs and past reports (mock data, of course)."
                
            -   "Then, I can ask: 'Summarise how we advise on debt management based on these documents.'"
                
            -   "Or: 'What has changed in our approach to risk assessment over the last 3 years, according to these reports?'"
                
        -   **üìå Emphasize:**
            
            -   "This tool is not for student data (yet) ‚Äì but it's perfect for internal playbooks, onboarding new TSO staff, ensuring consistency, and rapidly reusing your faculty's collective knowledge."
                
            -   "NotebookLM is like ChatGPT for your university's documents ‚Äî but traceable and referenceable."
                
    -   **üß† Discussion Prompt:**
        
        -   "What's something you've _wanted_ to do for faculty support, but never had the time or tools for?"
            
        -   "What would a junior TSO assistant, working 24/7 and able to read any policy instantly, let you do more of?"
            
        -   _Encourage sharing and brainstorming._
            
    -   **‚úÖ Optional Micro-Exercise: Reverse Prompt (if time allows, or assign as homework)**
        
        -   "Think of a task you've never had time for. Now, try to write a prompt that _tries_ to do that thing. What happens?"
            
        -   _Example: "Write a benchmarking summary comparing this semester's unit performance to 3 previous semesters. Highlight enrollment trends, completion rates, and resource utilization patterns."_
            
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "Automation is good. But transformation is better. The real power of AI is doing things you couldn‚Äôt do before. This is where competitive advantage lives."
        

#### **üîí 1:15‚Äì1:30 ‚Äî Secure & Sustainable AI Use**

-   **Purpose:** Ground the seminar in responsible AI use, building confidence in secure practices.
    
-   **Key Message:** "AI is only as smart as your context ‚Äî and only as safe as your systems. Work with it like a colleague: trust it, but verify, and never put it in a position to break the rules.‚Äù
    
-   **Handout:** `Secure_Sustainable_AI_Use.md`
    
-   **Handout:** `AI_Core_Tensions_Handout.md` (for deeper reflection)
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **üìÑ Framing Statement:**
        
        -   "Even if the AI gets the right answer, if you use the wrong data or tool, it can create serious risk. Let‚Äôs talk about what‚Äôs safe, what‚Äôs smart, and what‚Äôs sustainable in your setting."
            
    -   **üîç Key Principles (go through each point in the handout):**
        
        1.  **Use mock or public data in all experiments:** "Especially with public tools like ChatGPT. Never use real student data here."
            
        2.  **Assume anything entered into a public AI chat is public:** "Unless you have explicit enterprise agreements, treat it as a public forum."
            
        3.  **Use your secure platforms for sensitive work:** "Copilot within Microsoft 365 is enterprise-grade. Your data stays within your tenant and is _not_ used to train public models. This is critical for Curtin and student data protection."
            
        4.  **Prototype in chat tools, deploy in secure environments:** "Think of public AI as your sandbox for prompt engineering. Once you have a working workflow, move it to a secure environment like Copilot, or even automation tools like Zapier or n8n if appropriate."
            
        5.  **Governance is a team sport:** "Involve your IT and security teams. Keep logs of how AI is used, version your prompts, and understand data access."
            
    -   **üöß Platform Governance Comparison:**
        
        -   _Briefly discuss the table in the handout, emphasizing the distinction between public and enterprise-grade tools._
            
        -   "**ChatGPT/Claude:** Great for rapid prototyping with mock data. **Never** for student-sensitive information."
            
        -   "**Copilot Chat (in M365):** Your go-to for internal and faculty-facing work. It respects your existing permissions and data security."
            
        -   "**Gemini:** Use with caution, verify its data handling policies for your specific use case."
            
    -   **üöÄ Strategy Summary: Prompt, Process, Protect:**
        
        -   "To summarize our approach to responsible AI use:"
            
            1.  **Prompt It:** "Use AI chat to test your thinking, summarise ideas, and shape workflows."
                
            2.  **Process It:** "Move successful chains into tools like Copilot, n8n, or Zapier."
                
            3.  **Protect It:** "When it's sensitive or student-facing, work within secure systems."
                
    -   **üö∂ What to Say if Asked: "Can we use this for real student data?"**
        
        -   "Yes, but only in tools governed by Curtin's enterprise environment ‚Äî like Copilot in Microsoft 365. You can prototype freely in public AI with mock data, but never use real student data outside secure university systems."
            
    -   **ü§î Discussion (refer to `AI_Core_Tensions_Handout.md`):**
        
        -   "AI introduces some core tensions. Let's look at the 'Thinking vs. Replacing' or 'Speed vs. Safety' sections in your handout. What challenges do you foresee in balancing these in your daily work?"
            
        -   _Encourage a brief discussion on practical implications._
            
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "AI is only as smart as your context ‚Äî and only as safe as your systems. Work with it like a colleague: trust it, but verify, and never put it in a position to break the rules.‚Äù

-   **Handout:** `Personal_AI_Challenge_Worksheet.md`
    
-   **Talking Points:**
    
    -   **üß† Challenge Setup:**
        
        -   "You‚Äôve seen one-shot prompts. You‚Äôve seen collaborative chains. You‚Äôve seen CRAFT. Now let‚Äôs flip it around: what‚Äôs a task you do often ‚Äî or wish you could do ‚Äî that we haven‚Äôt covered?"
            
        -   "Your task is to fill out the 'Personal AI Challenge Worksheet'."
            
        -   **Participants choose one:**
            
            -   A **real task** they perform in Excel, Word, Teams, or Outlook.
                
            -   A **reporting or writing challenge** (summaries, strategy, risk, benchmarking).
                
            -   A **faculty question** they regularly field.
                
        -   **Then, on the worksheet:**
            
            -   "Identify the task/challenge."
                
            -   "Write your **first CRAFT-style prompt** for it."
                
            -   "Choose which tool you'd try (Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, NotebookLM)."
                
            -   "Define what success would look like for this task."
                
            -   "If you have time, try running your prompt in your chosen tool and note the results."
                
        -   _Give participants 10-12 minutes to work on this individually._
            
        -   _Circulate around the room to offer one-on-one support and answer questions._
            
    -   **üó£ Share & Reflect:**
        
        -   "Let's bring it back together. Would 1-2 volunteers be willing to share their challenge and what they experienced?"
            
        -   _If someone shares, guide the discussion:_
            
            -   "What was the original task?"
                
            -   "What was the AI's output like (briefly summarize)?"
                
            -   "What was your revised or improved prompt (if applicable)?"
                
        -   **Facilitator Highlight:**
            
            -   "Notice how prompt refinement is a form of thinking, not just correcting."
                
            -   "This is about collaboration, not just automation."
                
            -   "Consider how the choice of tool fits the task."
                
-   **Key Takeaway:**
    
    -   "This is where the real shift happens: not just using AI for the tasks I already do, but discovering how it can help me think, improve, and explore new possibilities. One prompt at a time."
