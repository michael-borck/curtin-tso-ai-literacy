## ⚙️ Automate the Tedious

This section focuses on how AI can eliminate repetitive and time-consuming tasks in teaching support operations, particularly around compliance documentation, impact analysis, and data consolidation. We'll explore how to evolve from basic prompting to complex, strategic workflows.

### 🎯 Purpose

Show how AI can help eliminate repetitive and time-consuming tasks that Teaching Support Officers perform daily — particularly around business case writing, compliance checking, and data analysis. Demonstrate the evolution from basic prompting to automated workflows that save hours of manual work.

### 🧠 Framing

*"Let's be honest — a lot of time is spent on repetitive compliance checks, reformatting documentation, and manual data collection. These tasks consume hours that could be spent on strategic support planning. AI can automate these processes."*

Guiding Questions for this section:
1. How can we automate what we already do?
2. What could we never do — until now?

### 🧪 Live Demo Examples (Conceptual)

We'll work with mock university data and policy excerpts. Tools: Copilot Chat, ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.

#### DEMO 1: Smart Business Case Generator
- **Initial Prompt:** "You are a Teaching Support Officer writing a business case for a new course. The proposal is in my rough notes. Draft a formal business case, ensuring it addresses all requirements outlined in Curtin's course approval policy and TEQSA guidelines."
- **Follow-Up Prompt:** "Now, flag any potential compliance gaps and suggest specific wording to ensure the document is ready for the faculty board."
- 📌 **Highlight:** This demonstrates immediate time savings and a direct link to the 'Quick Win' pilot project.

#### DEMO 2: Intelligent Impact Analysis
- **Prompt:** "The faculty is proposing to retire units X, Y, and Z. Using the provided (mock) student enrollment data, analyze which student cohorts are affected, suggest alternative pathways, and generate a summary table and chart for a board meeting."
- **Variation Prompt:** "Now create a risk assessment highlighting any students who might not graduate on time due to these changes."
- 📌 **Highlight:** This showcases the 'Strategic Win' and positions AI as a tool for more informed decision-making.

#### DEMO 3: Automated Data Workflow
- **Prompt:** "I have received three separate emails with semester availability for ENGR1001, PHYS2002, and MATH101. Extract the key information (unit, semester, tutorial count, quota) and consolidate it into a single table. Flag any potential timetable conflicts."
- **Follow-Up:** "Generate a formatted report for the timetabling committee with recommendations for conflict resolution."
- 📌 **Highlight:** This addresses the 'Operational Win' and demonstrates how AI can reduce the stress of manual data collection.

#### DEMO 4: Compliance Checking Workflow
- **Single Orchestration Prompt:** "Review this course proposal against Curtin's policies. Then: 1) identify compliance requirements, 2) highlight any gaps, 3) suggest specific improvements, and 4) draft an executive summary. Label each step."
- 📌 **Highlight:** Single prompt → comprehensive compliance review (agent-like behavior).

### 📊 Mock Unit Data Sample

| Semester | Unit Code | Enrollment | Capacity | Completion Rate | Resources |
|----------|-----------|------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| 2024 S1 | ENGR1001 | 285 | 300 | 92% | Full |
| 2024 S1 | PHYS2002 | 156 | 200 | 88% | Adequate |
| 2024 S1 | MATH101 | 420 | 400 | 85% | Over capacity |
| 2024 S1 | COMP3001 | 98 | 150 | 94% | Under-utilized |

### 🛠 Optional Prompt Enhancers

- "Use clear language suitable for faculty board presentations."
- "Structure as an executive summary with actionable recommendations."
- "Include compliance references to TEQSA standards."
- "Write like an experienced Teaching Support Officer."

### 💬 Discussion Prompt

"Which parts of your TSO workflow could benefit most from AI automation?"
"Where might AI help you move from reactive to proactive support planning?"

## 🔨 Prompt Crafting with CRAFT

Learn how to write better prompts that yield more relevant, high-quality AI responses using the structured CRAFT framework.

### 💡 Why It Matters

- Most disappointing AI results are due to vague or context-free prompts
- Structured prompts produce better outputs with less rework
- Good prompting is platform-agnostic: it works in ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude, etc.

*"Think of prompting like a briefing: the better you brief the AI, the better its draft. But also — the first prompt is rarely the final answer. Good prompts invite a conversation, not just a command."*

### 🧠 C.R.A.F.T Framework

| Letter | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| C | **Context** | "This data is from Curtin engineering units over 3 semesters." |
| R | **Role** | "You are a senior Teaching Support Officer." |
| A | **Action** | "Analyse enrollment trends and resource utilization." |
| F | **Format** | "Write in bullet points." |
| T | **Tone/Target** | "Use clear language for a faculty board presentation." |

*"You don't have to use every element every time — but this gives you the scaffolding."*

### 🛠 DEMO: Improving a Prompt with CRAFT

**Original Prompt:**
> "What's happening with student numbers?"

**Improved Prompt (with CRAFT):**
> "This is enrollment data from engineering units at Curtin over three semesters. You are an experienced Teaching Support Officer. Analyse the enrollment trends and identify any units at risk of low numbers. Output in three bullet points using clear language for the faculty board."

### 🗣️ Prompting as a Conversation

"CRAFT is a great starting point — but don't stop there. One-shot prompting can feel transactional. The real power is in using AI as a collaborator."

*"Think of CRAFT as your first message to a new colleague. The next steps are to discuss, clarify, iterate."*

**Example Chain:**
1. Craft a CRAFT-style analysis prompt
2. Follow up: "Add any compliance risks you identify."
3. Follow up: "Now restructure that for an executive summary."

## 🌟 Unlocking the Impossible

This section helps us see beyond automation to how AI can expand our capabilities, enabling tasks previously too complex, time-consuming, or costly.

### 💡 Framing Statement

*"So far, we've looked at how to automate what you already do. Now let's ask a better question: — What have you never been able to do because it felt too hard, too slow, or too expensive? AI may now make those things possible."*

### 🧠 Examples of "Impossible" Tasks AI Can Now Tackle

| Task Type | Previously Hard/Impossible | Now Possible With AI |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Policy synthesis | Reading & comparing multiple TEQSA documents | Summarise and extract requirements instantly |
| Report repurposing | Turning 1 analysis into multiple formats | Reformat for board, faculty, or students |
| Internal Q&A | Answering policy questions on demand | Query university docs via NotebookLM |
| Impact modeling | Manual analysis of course changes | AI-driven scenario exploration |
| Compliance checking | Line-by-line policy verification | Automated compliance gap analysis |

### 🤖 NotebookLM: AI That Knows Your Documents

NotebookLM is Google's AI notebook that reads and cites *your* content. Upload policies, procedures, TEQSA guidelines, and query them. It's great for internal insights, onboarding, and compliance checking.

**Use Cases for Teaching Support Officers:**
- Ask: "What are the requirements for course accreditation at Curtin?"
- Summarise changes in TEQSA guidelines over recent years
- New TSO staff can query policies without interrupting experienced colleagues

**Limitations:** Not suitable for student-sensitive content (yet). Still in beta — best used for internal knowledge reuse.

### 🧠 Discussion Prompt

> "What's something you've *wanted* to do for faculty support, but never had the time or tools for?"
> "What would a junior TSO assistant, working 24/7 and able to read any policy instantly, let you do more of?"

## 🔒 Secure & Sustainable AI Use

Grounding our AI exploration in responsible use is crucial. This section covers how to use AI confidently without risking sensitive data, and how to think long-term about secure, governed AI integration.

### 📄 Framing Statement

*"Even if the AI gets the right answer, if you use the wrong data or tool, it can create serious risk. Let's talk about what's safe, what's smart, and what's sustainable in your setting."*

### 🔍 Key Principles

#### Core AI Implementation Principles

1. **People-first Design**
   AI should enhance human capabilities, not replace human judgment. TSOs remain central to teaching support delivery.

2. **Responsible and Ethical Use of AI**
   Consider the impact on students, staff, and academic integrity. Ensure transparency in AI-assisted processes.

3. **Secure and Responsible Design**
   Align with Curtin's IT security policies and TEQSA compliance requirements. Protect student data and privacy.

#### Practical Safety Guidelines

1. **Use mock or public data in all experiments**
   Especially in exploratory or non-integrated tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude). Never use real student data outside secure systems.

2. **Assume anything entered into a public AI chat is public**
   Unless you *know* the tool offers enterprise privacy, don't paste student-identifiable or sensitive university information.

3. **Use your secure platforms for sensitive work**
   Copilot inside Microsoft 365 is enterprise-grade: your data stays in your tenant and isn't used to train models.

4. **Prototype in chat tools, deploy in secure environments**
   Test prompts with mock data in ChatGPT, then migrate your workflow to secure Copilot or approved university systems.

5. **Governance is a team sport**
   Involve your IT/security leads and Teaching & Learning committee when formalising AI use. Keep logs, version prompts, and review how tools access data.

### 🤖 AI Tools: What's Under the Hood?

- **Copilot / ChatGPT:** LLMs trained to predict useful text. Copilot is integrated into M365; ChatGPT is public-facing unless restricted.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Structuring your input (Context, Role, Action, Format, Task - CRAFT) to guide AI output.
- **Agents:** Tools that reason and act in steps. Conceptually similar to complex prompt chains.
- **Key Concepts:** Context Window (AI's short-term memory), Temperature (creativity/randomness), AI predicts, not "thinks".
- **Security & Risk:** Copilot data stays in your M365 tenant. Avoid student-sensitive data in public ChatGPT. Always verify AI output.

### 🚧 Platform Governance Comparison

| Tool | Use Case | Governance Notes |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Rapid prototyping, testing prompts | ❌ No student data. Treat like a public whiteboard. |
| **Copilot Chat** | Secure drafting in M365 | ✅ Safe for internal docs. Respects your permissions. |
| **Gemini** | Research, document analysis | ⚠️ Check data sharing policies. Not for confidential input. |
| **Claude** | Long context reasoning | ❌ Same privacy limits as ChatGPT. Use mock data only. |

### 🚶 What to Say if Asked: "Can we use this for real student data?"

> "Yes, but only in tools governed by Curtin's enterprise environment — like Copilot in Microsoft 365. You can prototype freely in public AI with mock data, but never use real student data outside secure university systems."

## ⚖️ Core Tensions in AI-Assisted Work

AI is powerful, but it introduces trade-offs. This section highlights key tensions to consider for balancing ambition with caution.

### 🧠 Thinking vs. Replacing

**Tension:** "AI thinks for me" vs. "AI replaces my work"
**What to Remember:** Use AI to support reasoning, not bypass it. It's a partner, not a substitute. TSOs provide the context, judgment, and human connection that AI cannot.

### 🎯 Prompting vs. Collaborating

**Tension:** One-shot prompting vs. Over-engineering prompts
**What to Remember:** Most good outcomes need back-and-forth. CRAFT is a start, not the finish. Think conversation, not command.

### 🔒 Efficiency vs. Security

**Tension:** Quick results vs. Data protection
**What to Remember:** Always prioritize student data security. Better to be slow and secure than fast and exposed.

### 🏁 Wrap-Up Thought

*"AI doesn't eliminate trade-offs — it just reshapes them. The best practitioners navigate these tensions with clarity, not certainty. You don't need to solve everything — you just need to notice where the friction lives."*
